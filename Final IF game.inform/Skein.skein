Many different baskets of fruit fill the store.  The exit to Cultural Plaza is to the east.

You can see green basket (in which is pears), pink basket (in which is peaches), and a red basket (in which is Apples) here.

The red basket catches your attention.

The center of this nice little mall with stores surrounding you, and bushes decorating the outside.  It is outdoors and deserted.  No one is sitting on the benches like they usually do.
  
There is a nice little directory here too, showing all the stores.

You can see a worn out book and an Instruction Manual here.

You hear the speedy swings of the machete cutting the air.
You can hear the loud heavy footsteps from the Madman Mercer as he walks into the room,  I would recommend not staying too long in this room.

Cultural Plaza
The center of this nice little mall with stores surrounding you, and bushes decorating the outside.  It is outdoors and deserted.  No one is sitting on the benches like they usually do.
  
There is a nice little directory here too, showing all the stores.

You can see a worn out book and an Instruction Manual here.

Backstage
A strange room that you wouldn&apos;t have guessed to be behind the stage of Cultual Plaza.  The room surrounds you with metal walls and a very bright light, like the ones they use in surgeries hanging from the ceiling.

A metal box the size of and Xbox 360, that has a dial which can spin to any number on the front.  It looks very solid, so I wouldn&apos;t waste your energy on trying force it open.

Cultural Plaza
The center of this nice little mall with stores surrounding you.  It is outdoors and deserted unlike how lively it usually is, with the old chinese folk sitting on the benches outside by the bushes playing there violin, and the many old chinese folk slowly moving there bodies in an intense session of Tai-Chi.  There are exits to the north, northeast, northwest, west, east, south, southeast, and southwest.

Backstage
A strange room that you wouldn&apos;t have guessed to be behind the stage of Cultual Plaza.  The room surrounds you with metal walls and a very bright light, like the ones they use in surgeries hanging from the ceiling.

A metal box the size of and Xbox 360, that has a dial which can spin to any number on the front.  It looks very solid, so I wouldn&apos;t waste your energy on trying force it open.

You can also see a red door here.

Cultural Plaza
The center of this nice little mall with stores surrounding you, and bushes decorating the outside.  It is outdoors and deserted.  No one is sitting on the benches like they usually do.
  
There is a nice little directory here too, showing all the stores.

You can see a worn out book and an Instruction Manual here.

Madman Mercer looks into your soul with his blood shot eyes running at you.  I wouldn&apos;t be in his line of sight for too long if i were you.
